    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of how to use SymPy to do symbolic calculations in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use as an example the acceleration of an Atwood machine.   The acceleration is given by: \n",
    "$$a = g \\frac{M-m}{M+m}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we want to find an expression for $\\delta a$ in terms of the measured quantities: $M \\pm \\delta m$, $m \\pm \\delta m$, and $g \\pm \\delta g$.   \n",
    "\n",
    "## Error Propagation Recipe\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a 5-step recipe for general error propagation. \n",
    "1. **Identify the equation:** In this example: $$a = g \\frac{M-m}{M+m}.$$\n",
    "1. **Identify the uncertain variables:** In this case: $M \\pm \\delta m$, $m \\pm \\delta m$, and $g \\pm \\delta g$.\n",
    "1. **Take the partial derivatives of the equation with respect to each uncertain variable:**  We need to calculate: $$\\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial M}, \\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial m}, \\text{and} \\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial g}.$$ We will do this with Sympy. \n",
    "1. **Calculate error contributions from each variable:** I need to calculate: $\\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial M} \\delta M$... for each variable.   We will also do this with SymPy. \n",
    "1. **Add all error contributions in quadrature:** In our example, we will need to evaluate: $$\\delta a = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial M} \\delta M\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial m} \\delta m\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial a}{\\partial g} \\delta g\\right)^2}$$.\n",
