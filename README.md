# Python Tutorials
A repository to house Jupyter and Python tutorials for the Basic Physics Laboratory courses.
The tutorials are arranged by subject. Each subject contains a summary guide for those unfamiliar with it, and many smaller examples 
and little guides. We recommend starting reading with the summary guide first.

## Contents

1. [Basics of Jupyter Notebooks](1%20Jupyter%20Notebook%20Basics) & this lab course
    * It is best to read these in order, if this is your first time with Jupyter!
    * [Setting up Lab Folder](1%20Jupyter%20Notebook%20Basics/1%20Setting%20Up%20Lab%20Folder.ipynb)
    * [Cell Mechanics]
2. [Basics of Python](2%20Python%20Basics)
3. Storing and Processing Raw Data: [Data Frames & Pandas](3%20Data%20Frames%20%26%20Pandas)
4. [Plotting in Python](4%20Plotting)

We hope we all have fun, and as always, ask us any questions! 
We would love any feedback on these tutorials, and we will do our best to add any additional examples that may help!
